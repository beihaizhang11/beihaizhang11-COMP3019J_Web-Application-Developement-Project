\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Goals}
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive university website that offers a personalized
 and functional experience for different types of users. The website will provide students, teachers, and other university 
 personnel with an interface to manage their profiles, interact with others, and access university resources based on their 
 roles. The website is expected to enhance user engagement, facilitate communication, and streamline administrative processes 
 within the university. Additionally, the project will focus on secure data handling and innovative functionalities to 
 differentiate the website from existing solutions.

\subsection{Target Users and Use Cases} The target users of the website include students, teachers, library staff, security personnel, 
administrative staff and external visitors. Each user type has specific features tailored to their role:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Students}: Students will have access to their dashboard, which display timetables, profiles, and
  enrolled courses. They can register for courses, check their grades, interact with teachers and fellow students, view library
  collections, and check their own borrowing history, as well as manage their electric bike licenses.
  \item \textbf{Teachers}: Teachers will have a dashboard that shows the courses they teach, timetable, profiles, and office
  location. They can create and manage courses, interact with students, view library collections.
  \item \textbf{Library staff}: Library staff will have access to features that allow them to manage book inventories, track book
  loans, and assist users with book reservations. They can also update library resources and monitor the availability of digital
  content for users.
  \item \textbf{Security personnel}: Security personnel will manage electric bike licenses and oversee vehicle registrations on
  campus.
  \item \textbf{Administrative staff}: Administrative users will have full control over the system, including managing user
  registrations, overseeing course creation, and handling overall database management to ensure smooth system operation.
  \item \textbf{External visitors}: Unregistered users will have limited access to parts of the website, such as viewing general
  information about the university, available library resources without the ability  interact with internal functions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technological Stack Overview}
The university website will be built using a modern and robust technological stack to ensure reliability, security, and scalability.
The core technologies to be used include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: The user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and
     responsive design. Libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI may be incorporated for consistent styling across the website.
    \item \textbf{Backend}: The server-side logic will be implemented using Flask (Python), providing a flexible framework for
    managing user authentication, database interactions, and session management.
    \item \textbf{Database}: MySQL will be used as the primary database management system to store user profiles,
    course data, library resources, electric bike licenses, and forum information. The database will include the design of
    tables with appropriate relationships, such as primary and foreign keys, to ensure data integrity and support efficient
    querying and management.
    \item \textbf{Security}: The website will ensure secure handling of sensitive data, such as passwords, using encryption
    mechanisms. Proper user authentication and authorization will be implemented to protect user privacy and data access.
\end{itemize}
This technology stack has been chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and suitability for the scale of the university website project,
ensuring a smooth user experience and maintainability.

\subsection{Entity-Relationship Diagrams}
The database for the university website currently includes several key tables: \texttt{user},
\texttt{student\_profile}, \texttt{teacher\_profile}, \texttt{library\_staff\_profile},
\texttt{security\_personnel\_profile}, \texttt{course}, \texttt{course\_registration}, \texttt{library\_resources},
\texttt{library\_loan}, \texttt{e\_bike\_license}, \texttt{forum\_post} and \texttt{forum\_reply}.\\ \\
These tables represent the foundational structure for managing users and their interactions with the system,
such as course enrollment and profile management. To support additional functionalities outlined in the introduction,
tables have been added to manage library resources, electric bike licenses, and forum discussions.
These expansions ensure that students, teachers, library staff, and security personnel can effectively interact
with the system in their respective roles. \\ \\
The Entity-Relationship Diagrams are on the next page:

        \item \texttt{color\_scheme} (Preferred color scheme, e.g., blue, green)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Primary and Foreign Key Design}
Each table contains a primary key that uniquely identifies each record. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between users and the entities they interact with. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{user\_id} field in \texttt{student\_profile}, \texttt{teacher\_profile},
    \texttt{library\_staff\_profile}, and \texttt{security\_personnel\_profile} links the
    profiles to the core \texttt{user} table.
    \item The \texttt{course\_id} field in \texttt{course\_registration} and \texttt{student\_grades} links
    students to the courses they have enrolled in and the grades they have received.
    \item The \texttt{license\_id} in the \texttt{e\_bike\_license} table allows students
    to register electric bikes, which are approved by security personnel.
    \item The \texttt{post\_id} and \texttt{reply\_id} in the \texttt{forum\_post} and \texttt{forum\_reply}
    tables link forum posts and their replies to the users who created them.
    \item The \texttt{user\_id} field in the \texttt{ui\_preferences} table links users to their personalized
    interface settings, such as theme, font size, and color scheme.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Population Strategy}
The initial data for the \texttt{user}, \texttt{course}, and \texttt{library\_resources}
tables will be seeded by administrators during development and testing phases. As users
interact with the system, data will be dynamically added to the \texttt{course\_registration},
\texttt{student\_grades}, \texttt{library\_loan}, \texttt{e\_bike\_license}, \texttt{forum\_post},
\texttt{forum\_reply}, and \texttt{ui\_preferences} tables. The system will ensure that all data
remains up-to-date and consistent across these entities, allowing users to track their course
registrations, grades, library loans, and personalized interface preferences.
